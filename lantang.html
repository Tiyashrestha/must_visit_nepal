                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>
                        Upon your arrival at Tribhuvan International, you will meet our representative from Adventure Himalayan Travels and Treks at the terminal gate.
                          After a quick meet and greet, you will be transferred to the hotel in a private vehicle by them. After freshening up, you are free to explore the valley.
                        Meet your crew members in the evening for a briefing session about your daily itinerary led by our guide or team leader over a complimentary dinner.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Day 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        The road winds through a series of twists and turns persistently for about 8 to 9 hours to cover 117 km from Kathmandu via the Prithvi Highway, ending in Syabrubesi, where you will find a lodge to spend the first night. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Day 3</h4>
                    <p>
                        Today, you will walk for about five and a half hours when the first part of the trail crosses through Bhote Koshi and follows the Langtang Khola, which is a gradual ascent up to Bamboo, passing through Landslide.
                        Afterward, your trek ascends gently to Rimche (2,400m) through Bamboo (1,960 m), which lies at the bank of Langtang Khola. You can have lunch at this place if you like.
                        At the end, your trail levels up to the Lama Hotel and finally to Sherpa Gaou. On your fortunate day, en route, you could see red pandas, monkeys, and bears.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Day 4</h4>
                     <p>
                        After Lama Hotel, you will climb through a rhododendron forest with the ground covered by moss. Trees have ferns and epiphytic orchids on them, which look like semi-tropical jungles.
                        As you continue climbing, there are occasional glimpses of Langtang Lirung between the trees. At Ghora Tabela (3,000m), the trail emerges from the forest. Once there was a Tibetan resettlement project here, but now it is a Nepalese army post, though it doesn’t have permanent inhabitants.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Day 5</h4>
                     <p>
                        The trail today is gradually uphill through small villages and yak pastures as the valley opens out further and the views become more extensive. After crossing several small streams and moraines, the trail settles in Kyanjin. 
                        Here, there is a small monastery and a government-operated cheese factory. Arriving at Kyangjin by lunchtime allows time to acclimatize and explore the area, which is a dramatic setting with snow-covered peaks surrounding you in all directions, such as Langtang Lirung, Ganjala Peak, Tserko-Ri, Langsisa-Ri, and many others.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Day 6</h4>
                     <p>
                        You will use Kyanjin Gompa, which is the last permanent settlement with a small gompa and a cheese factory, as a base for day hikes to explore the upper valley and attempt to climb the small hill in the north of Khayanjing, or Tsergo(5,033 m).
                     <h4>Day 7</h4>
                     <p>
                        This day presents you with a lot to explore in and around Kyanjin Gompa, which gives 360-degree, complete views of the Langtang Lirung, Genjempol, and Kenga Himal ranges.
